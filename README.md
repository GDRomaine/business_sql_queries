## business_sql_queries

In this project, I query `chinook.db`, a mock database for the "Chinook music
record store" provided to me by [dataquest.io](https://www.dataquest.io/). It simulates
a database that an actual business might use storing all the information
regarding customers, invoices, and products (track, artist, album, genre, etc.).

The motivation behind the project is to showcase my ability to make complex
SQL queries and answer typical business intelligence questions.

Note: throughout the project, I write with plural subject pronouns as opposed to
singular subject pronouns (e.g. "We have" vs. "I have"). Please do not make the
mistake of assuming a team of people were behind this project. I worked on this
project alone. I simply prefer this writing style for data science projects as
it feels more inclusive -- as if you and I are walking through the project
together :)
