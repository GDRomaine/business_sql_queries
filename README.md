## business_sql_queries

In this project, I query `chinook.db`, a mock database for the "Chinook music
record store" provided to me by [dataquest.io](https://www.dataquest.io/). It simulates
a database that an actual business might use storing all the information
regarding customers, invoices, and products (track, artist, album, genre, etc.).

The motivation behind the project is to showcase my ability to make complex
SQL queries and answer typical business intelligence questions.
